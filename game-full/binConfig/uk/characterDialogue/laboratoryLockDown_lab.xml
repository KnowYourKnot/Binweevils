		<text width="500">Oh nooooo! It is absolutely impossible to get into that chamber, I made it out of Ultra-Unbreakabilium! Our only hope is to somehow overheat the machine and destroy it!</text>

		<text width="500">Right. Think, brain, think! AHA! Got it! You can use the laser to shoot those boosters on the wall. The energy surge will overload the machine. First, you have to connect the generator to activate the laser.</text>

		<text width="500">Oh, one more wee word of advice. That machine? You'll have to overload ALL the boosters at once. If you miss any green lights, the system will repair itself and you'll have to start again. I built this thing well!</text>
