							<h4 class="title is-3">1. The Information We Collect</h4>
							<p><b>Information We Collect Automatically</b></p>
							<p>When users visit one of our Services, we may automatically collect information about them such as IP address, mobile device identifier or other unique identifier, browser and computer type, access time, originating web page, next URL, web page(s) accessed during a user’s visit, and interaction with content and/or advertising on the Services (“Usage Data”).</p>
							<p>When users decide to register for our Services we collect a parent's email address, a unique username, a password, and their IP address. This information is required to provide our Services.</p>
							<p>We require parent's permission and consent for users that are not old enough to consent themselves and it is assumed during registration that either a parent is present or has given prior permission for their child. Activation of an account via a parent's email address confirms consent for their child to use our Services.</p>
							<p>Parents may revoke their consent and begin the process of information removal by contacting us directly.</p>
							<p>Users may choose to communicate on our Services via the chat function provided, this function is not intended to be private and all messages are stored indefinitely</p>
							<h4 class="title is-3">2. How Information Is Used</h4>
							<p>We may use users’ information in an aggregate, (i.e. non-personally identifiable) form to identify viewership trends on our website. We also use it to improve the interface and content of the website.</p>
							<p>We may use users’ email addresses to send a marketing emails summarizing upcoming events and updates if they have opted-in at registration.</p>
							<h4 class="title is-3">3. How Long Information Is Stored</h4>
							<p>All directly-collected information is stored indefinitely, that is until our Services cease operating.</p>
							<p>We ask our analytics provider, Google Analytics, to remove user-specific information after a period of 26 months in which there has been no interaction from the user. After this time period has passed the only information that is kept is done so in an aggregate form which cannot be linked back to an individual.</p>
							<p>Messages sent on our Services via the chat function are stored indefinitely and will be retained anonymised in case of user delection.</p>
							<h4 class="title is-3">4. How Long Information Is Shared</h4>
							<p>We do not sell any information that we have collected.</p>
							<p>We may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or to third parties under certain circumstances such as in response to court orders, warrants, or subpoenas.</p>
							<p>If we believe sharing of information will help or is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, fraud, or situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person or property.</p>
							<p>If required we may share information to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
							<p>If we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or act regarding significant abuse of the Services infrastructure or the Internet in general (such as denial of service attacks, or attempts to compromise the security of information).</p>
							<h4 class="title is-3">5. Information Removal</h4>
							<p>Marketing and promotional emails we sent to Users have an opt-out and an unsubscribe link if Users no longer wish to receive optional updates from us.</p>
							<p>You can request a permanent deletion of the information you have explicitly provided us during User registration by contacting us.</p>
							<p>Rejecting or removing cookies may result in some areas of our website and Services to cease functioning correctly.</p>
							<p>Information deletion does not opt you out of being served generic advertising.</p>

							<p>In the event of a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data, we shall promptly assess the risk to users’ rights and freedoms.</p>
							<h4 class="title is-3">7. Privacy Policy</h4>
